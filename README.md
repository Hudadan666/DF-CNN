# DF-CNN
The code is evaluated on Python 3.6 with PyTorch 1.2.0 and MATLAB R2018b

## Step1 Dataset preparation  
Download the datasets you need as below, and extract these datasets to $ROOT_DIR/data/  folder  
wget http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/bsds_pascal_train_pair.lst  
wget http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/HED-BSDS.tar.gz  
wget http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/PASCAL.tar.gz  

## Step2 train DF-CNN  
1.Download the datasets you need in step1  
2.Download the model for initialization in [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FLT5fDKmrHneZuAOMzECMA), it's password is 7aqf and then put the model in $ROOT_DIR folder  

## Step3 evaluation
Our best model you can get in [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/15YrQVeHXFOvocSqXoke5xQ), it's password is yzgz  
1.run the test.py  
2.refer to the evaluation way of [HED](https://github.com/xwjabc/hed)
